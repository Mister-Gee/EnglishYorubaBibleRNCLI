But Job answered and said,6:2 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
26:3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
26:4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
26:5 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
26:6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.
26:8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
26:9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
26:10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
26:11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
26:12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
26:13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
26:14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
27:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,7:2 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;
27:3 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
27:4 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
27:5 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
27:6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
27:7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
27:8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
27:9 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
27:10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
27:11 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
27:12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
27:13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
27:14 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
27:15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
27:16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;
27:17 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
27:18 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
27:19 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.
27:20 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
27:21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
27:22 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
27:23 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
28:1
